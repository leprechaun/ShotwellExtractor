Shotwell Extrator
=================

Another quick hacky script with SQLAlchemy and Python3. It extracts all pictures and tags of your shotwell database and write them to json files in (default) ./output

Why? You ask? I'm testing Angular.js and figured I could do a 100% static galery project. Might as well dogfeed.
